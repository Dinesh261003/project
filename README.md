                                           ABSTRACT

Smart home security refers to the integration of technology into home security systems to enhance safety and convenience. It typically involves the use of devices such as security cameras, motion sensors and alarms that can be controlled remotely via a smartphone or other internet-connected devices. Additionally, smart home security systems may incorporate features such as facial recognition, voice control, and integration with other smart home devices for a comprehensive security solution. In this, traditional home security systems rely on sensors and alarms, which can be triggered by accidental events or miss intruders altogether


This project proposes a smart home security system utilizing computer vision for real-time intrusion detection and also provide a secure and efficient visitor authentication solution using face recognition technology and  cameras in real-world scenarios. It uses face recognition technology for secure access control in buildings. This system's authentication process involves detecting the visitor's face, extracting facial features, and comparing them with the registered family members' facial feature information in the database. This project also includes security measures to prevent unauthorized access, such as detecting and alerting users to avoid from surfing attacks.


Computer vision enables intelligent monitoring of the surroundings, detecting and tracking intruders or suspicious activities with greater accuracy compared to motion sensors alone and  can distinguish between different objects and individuals, reducing false alarms triggered by pets, moving shadows, or non-threatening movements. Also , homeowners can receive tailored alerts based on specific events, such as recognizing familiar faces or identifying unrecognized individuals entering the premises. Continued advancements in computer vision algorithms and hardware technology can lead to improved accuracy in detecting and identifying objects and individuals, reducing false positives and false negatives. As computer vision technology matures, smart home security systems may offer new and innovative use cases beyond traditional surveillance, such as health monitoring, eldercare, and environmental monitoring.



OBJECTIVES


1.	Reduce False Alarms: Develop a computer vision system capable of accurately distinguishing between authorized presence (homeowners, pets) and potential intrusions, minimizing the number of false alarms triggered by traditional sensors   


2.	Real time monitoring: Utilize computer vision algorithms to continuously monitor the home environment in real-time, detecting and analyzing activities and events as they occur.


3.	Accurate detection: Employ advanced object detection and recognition techniques to accurately identify people, vehicles, and other objects, minimizing false alarms and ensuring prompt responses to genuine security threats.

  
4.	Customized Alerts: Provide personalized alerts to homeowners based on specific events detected by the system, such as unauthorized entry, suspicious behavior, or package deliveries, allowing for timely intervention or action.

PROPOSED SYSTEM:


The proposed smart home security system utilizes computer vision-equipped cameras for real-time event detection and analysis. Integrating with existing smart sensors, it offers high-accuracy detection of security threats like unauthorized entry. Real-time alerts and automated responses mitigate risks, while an intuitive user interface empowers homeowners to manage settings conveniently. This comprehensive solution enhances security coverage and responsiveness, providing peace of mind for residents.

 RESULT

 Home security systems incorporating computer vision technology offer advanced surveillance capabilities, revolutionizing the way we protect our homes. By leveraging sophisticated algorithms and high-resolution cameras, these systems can detect and analyze various activities in and around the premises with remarkable accuracy. Upon detecting suspicious movements or unauthorized access, they can promptly alert homeowners or security personnel, enabling quick response to potential threats


 One of the key advantages of computer vision-based home security systems is their ability to distinguish between different objects and behaviors, thereby minimizing false alarms. Additionally, advanced features such as facial recognition and license plate recognition enhance security measures, enabling homeowners to monitor specific individuals or vehicles of interest.


 Furthermore, integration with smart home technology enables seamless control and monitoring from anywhere through mobile applications or web interfaces. Users can remotely view live camera feeds, receive real-time alerts, and even interact with visitors through two-way audio communication. Moreover, the integration with other smart devices such as door locks, lights, and thermostats allows for comprehensive automation and enhanced security protocols
